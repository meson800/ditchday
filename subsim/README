Depdencies
----------
To build the client, you need SDL2, SDL2-ttf SDL2-gfx, and OpenAL installed.
You also need CMake to make either the client or the game master
On Ubuntu(esque) things this requires:

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-1.0-0 libsdl2-gfx-dev libopenal1 libopenal-dev cmake

Building
--------
First, make sure that the RakNet submodule has been downloaded. We use a 
submodule so we can track a specific version, without duplicating all of the
code for this version in this repo. If you didn't do a recursive checkout, run

git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive --remote

Then, do a normal CMake build! Run

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

The build produces two executables, one for the server and one for the client.
Run them in two separate terminals:

cd build/game_master
./subsim_gm -f test/test_game.cfg

cd build/client
./subsim_client -s localhost
