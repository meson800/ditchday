Depdencies
----------
To build the client, you need OpenAL installed. You also need CMake.
On Ubuntu(esque) things this requires:

sudo apt-get intall libopenal1 libopenal-dev cmake


Building
--------
First, make sure that the RakNet submodule has been downloaded. We use a 
submodule so we can track a specific version, without duplicating all of the
code for this version in this repo. If you didn't do a recursive checkout, run

git submodule update --recursive --remote

Then, do a normal CMake build! Run

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

After that, in the build directory, there should be two executables, at

game_master/subsim_gm
client/subsim_client

Make sure these both run!
